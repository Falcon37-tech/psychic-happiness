Today's Problem is -

You are given a rectangular matrix mat[][] of size n x m, and your task is to return an array while traversing the matrix in spiral form.
Examples:

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 15, 14, 13, 9, 5, 6, 7, 11, 10]
Explanation: 

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
Explanation: Applying same technique as shown above.
Input: mat[][] = [[32, 44, 27, 23], [54, 28, 50, 62]]
Output: [32, 44, 27, 23, 62, 50, 28, 54]
Explanation: Applying same technique as shown above, output will be [32, 44, 27, 23, 62, 50, 28, 54].
Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 1000
0 <= mat[i][j]<= 100

Solution
Code-
class Solution:
    # Function to return a list of integers denoting spiral traversal of matrix.
    def spirallyTraverse(self, mat):
        result = []
        if not matrix:
            return result
        
        top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1
        left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1
        
        while top <= bottom and left <= right:
            
            for i in range(left, right + 1):
                result.append(matrix[top][i])
            top += 1
            
            for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
                result.append(matrix[i][right])
            right -= 1
            
            if top <= bottom:
                for i in range(right, left - 1, -1):
                    result.append(matrix[bottom][i])
                bottom -= 1
            
            if left <= right:
                for i in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):
                    result.append(matrix[i][left])
                left += 1
        return result
