Today's challenge is - 


Given an array of integers arr[] and a number k, count the number of subarrays having XOR of their elements as k.

Examples: 

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], k = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 6 are [4, 2], [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], [2, 2, 6], and [6]. Hence, the answer is 4.
Input: arr[] = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 5 are [5] and [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Hence, the answer is 2.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], k = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays are [1, 1], [1, 1], [1, 1] and [1, 1, 1, 1].
Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤105
0 ≤ k ≤ 105

Solution
Code -
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def subarrayXor(self, arr, k):
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        count = 0
        xor_sum = 0
        
        for num in arr:
            xor_sum ^= num
            
            if xor_sum == k:
                count += 1
            
            count += freq[xor_sum ^ k]
            
            freq[xor_sum] += 1
            
        return count
