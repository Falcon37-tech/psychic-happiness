Today's Problem is - 

Given an array arr[] of positive integers and another integer target. Determine if there exist two distinct indices such that the sum of their elements is equal to the target.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 4, 45, 6, 10, 8], target = 16
Output: true
Explanation: arr[3] + arr[4] = 6 + 10 = 16.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 6], target = 11
Output: false
Explanation: None of the pair makes a sum of 11.
Input: arr[] = [11], target = 11
Output: false
Explanation: No pair is possible as only one element is present in arr[].
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
1 ≤ target ≤ 2*105

Solution
Code-

class Solution:
	def twoSum(self, arr, target):
		seen = {}
		for i, num in enumerate(arr):
		    complement = target - num
		    if complement in seen and seen[complement] != i:
		        return True
		    seen[num] = i
		    
		return False
