Today's Problem was-

Given a head of the singly linked list. If a loop is present in the list then return the first node of the loop else return NULL.

Custom Input format:
A head of a singly linked list and a pos (1-based index) which denotes the position of the node to which the last node points to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop.

Examples:

Input:
 
Output: 3
Explanation: We can see that there exists a loop in the given linked list and the first node of the loop is 3.
Input:
 
Output: -1
Explanation: No loop exists in the above linked list.So the output is -1.
Constraints:
1 <= no. of nodes <= 106
1 <= node->data <= 106 

Solution
Code -

#User function Template for python3

""" Node Class
    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):   # data -> value stored in node
            self.data = data
            self.next = None
"""
class Solution:
    def findFirstNode(self, head):
        slow = head
        fast = head
        
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            
            if slow == fast:
                slow = head
                
                while slow != fast:
                    slow = slow.next
                    fast = fast.next
                return slow
        return None
